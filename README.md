## Who am I? 😊
I'm Alyx, a SysOps Engineer working from home, in France.

I joined Selectra in 2014 as a Ruby on Rails Engineer. After getting more and more professional with my skills, because the company was growing at a fast pace, I became the CTO in 2015. I had various roles during these years: hiring, management, SysOps Engineer, Ruby on Rails Engineer. After hiring engineers, implementing IT processes, and stabilizing our growing infrastructure, I left my seat to someone more experienced than me and focused on our SysOps needs in 2019.

As a SysOps Engineer, I improved our hosting architecture and tools. I've migrated all our infrastructure from dedicated servers that we outgrew to AWS (*Elastic Kubernetes Service, S3, DynamoDB, Relational Database Service, Elastic Container Registry, Network Load-Balancer, Identity and Access Management, VPC*) thanks to Terraform and Kubernetes. I've also deployed observability tools for our Ruby/PHP applications using [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/) and our Docker builds on CI pipelines through [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/). I was continuously refining our CI/CD pipelines to make them as fast as I could, thanks to [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com/) and Docker caching.

Today, I'm a Senior Infrastructure Engineer @ [Docker](https://docker.com/company/) since June 2022 and I'm really excited about this new chapter in my career!

## What I ❤️ about my job

I find joy in automation and giving the right tools to our teams to learn about how their apps are running. Finding performance issues, no matter where they are, and fixing them is one of my favorite things. You can count on me to make some cool graphs showing the improvements! 📊

I was using [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) @ Selectra, and now [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) @ Docker to write and share internal posts to explain in detail what I'm working on, my findings, how is it going to help, etc... I'm also using these tools to easily manage all my work. I'm also a strong believer in asynchronous communication for most of our work.
